## Financial Performance

Revenue grew 4.2% to $3,778m (FY24: $3,624m), with a five-year CAGR of 6.4% from FY21's $2,948m. Operating subsidy declined 1.5% to $597m, indicating a modest drift toward commercial self-sufficiency over time.

**Profitability** was strong. NPAT increased 6.3% to $1,126m, with the NPAT margin edging up to 29.8% (FY24: 29.2%). EBIT (surplus before tax + net interest) of $1,742m represents a 46.1% EBIT margin, roughly flat on FY24's 46.4%. The surplus before income tax of $1,611m exceeded the $1,594m target by 1.1%.

**Cost discipline is under pressure.** Direct operating expenses grew 5.0% to $1,377m — faster than revenue growth — lifting the opex-to-revenue ratio to 36.4% (FY24: 36.2%). The operating cost per property of $1,093 missed its $1,045 target by 4.5%, and total cost per property of $2,465 missed $2,412 by 2.2%. Both have risen for five consecutive years. The five-year trajectory (opex per property: $808 → $1,093, +35%) points to structural cost growth that tariff increases are tracking but not fully absorbing.

**Debt reduction is on a positive trajectory but slowed materially.** Net repayments of $97m in FY25 compare to $639m in FY24 and $389m in FY23 — the slowdown reflects the significant capital investment ramp-up rather than any deterioration in earnings. Total borrowings have fallen $1.5bn from their FY21 peak ($6,022m) to $4,516m. Debt/Total Assets of 21.0% is well inside the 25.3% target, providing headroom. Net interest expense fell $36m year-on-year to $131m, the lowest in the five-year series, though interest cover of 7.8x marginally missed its 8.1x target.

**Capital investment surged 44% to $1,425m** (FY24: $988m), representing 37.7% of revenue (FY24: 27.3%) — the highest capital intensity in the five-year period. ROE of 7.3% is marginally below the 7.5% target, consistent with a high-capex phase diluting near-term equity returns. ROA of 5.7% met its target precisely.

## Safe for All (Water Quality)

Metro performance was perfect across all four measures for the fifth consecutive year. Country performance was near-perfect on E.coli (100%) and health-related chemical quality (100%) but saw two marginal misses: amoebae at 99.55% and radiological at 99.19% (vs 100% target for both). The radiological shortfall (99.19%) is a slight deterioration from 99.08% in FY24 — both below target, warranting monitoring.

## Environmentally Sustainable

Swan-Canning overflow incidents fell to zero on both measures (down from 2 and 6 in FY24) — a strong recovery and on target.

GHG emissions of 578kT edged above the 568kT target, and are up from 545kT in FY24, partly driven by the significant increase in energy-intensive desalination output. Electricity intensity for water treatment (2.03 MWh/ML) is well inside the 2.15 MWh/ML target and an improvement on FY24's 1.77 MWh/ML uplift toward the 5-year high. Wastewater electricity intensity of 0.80 MWh/ML is below the 0.85 target. Biosolids reuse held at 100% and no legal sanctions have been recorded in five years. Environment non-compliances addressed (92.2%) missed the 95.0% target and represents the lowest rate in the five-year window.

## Satisfied Customers

**Continuity remains the standout weakness.** Only 64.0% of properties avoided a supply interruption exceeding one hour — materially below the 75.0% target and effectively unchanged from FY24 (64.2%). This is the only customer metric trending in the wrong direction and has now underperformed target for three consecutive years.

All other customer metrics performed well. Complaints (0.2 per 1,000) and blockages per 100km (13.8) are at or near five-year lows, both well inside target. Leaks and bursts (15.9 per 100km) and new connection installation (98.5%) both exceeded targets. Water supplied per capita tracked precisely on the 127kL target, suggesting demand management is effective despite the growing network.

## Supporting State Development

**Safety (TRIFR)** of 4.7 misses the 3.0 target by 57% and has not met target across the full five-year series. It improved from FY24's 5.6, continuing a gradual downward trend, but remains the most significant performance gap in this section.

**Gender diversity** is mixed by tier: Tier 2 leadership at 71.4% substantially exceeds the 42.0% target, while Tier 3 at 39.5% sits just below 42.0% — indicating pipeline development is needed in the broader management layer.

**Workforce diversity** metrics are uniformly below target: Indigenous representation (4.7% vs 7.0%), cultural diversity (14.0% vs 15.5%), people with disabilities (1.7% vs 5.0%), and youth (4.6% vs 5.8%). Disability representation in particular has a significant gap that has been persistent across all five years. Employee turnover of 7.8% is comfortably within the 10.0% threshold and has stabilised after the FY23 spike to 10.3%.
